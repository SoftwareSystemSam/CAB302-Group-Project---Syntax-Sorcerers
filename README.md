Project Brief:
For our project our group has chosen the screen time tracker. This app will monitor the time a user has a screen open for the applications they have open. We hope this data alongside general health advice will help promote healthier computer usage/screen time habits for users. 
The project requirements are:
•	The app will be able to display statistical data based on the users’ screen time for each application through a GUI (Can do daily, weekly, monthly stats).

•	Users will be able to sign-up for an account with username and password.

•	This account will allow users to store their data and retrieve it from a database.

•	 There will be a section that will show general health information from professional medical sources surrounding computer usage, such as regular breaks, proper posture, computer station ergonomics etc.

•	The app will include customizable notifications for users when they exceed predetermined screen time limits for specific applications or overall daily usage.
